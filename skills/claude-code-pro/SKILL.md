# Claude Code Pro

Expert-level mastery of the Claude ecosystem. Focuses on leveraging Claude's unique strengths: long context windows, precise tool use, and Artifact-driven UI prototyping.

## Boundary

**`claude-code-pro`** covers the use of Claude Code CLI, Claude Projects (custom instructions, file management), and Artifacts. It includes techniques for "Chain of Thought" steering and managing multi-file context.

## When to use

- Setting up a professional Claude Project for a large codebase.
- Optimizing complex prompts to reduce token usage while maintaining precision.
- Orchestrating Claude Code CLI for automated refactoring or testing.
- Designing interactive UI demos using Claude Artifacts.

## Workflow

1. **Context Mapping**: Identify the essential files and dependencies for the task.
2. **Instruction Engineering**: Craft precise Project Instructions or System Prompts.
3. **Tool Selection**: Determine when to use CLI tools vs. chat-based reasoning.
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Use feedback loops to guide Claude's "Chain of Thought".
5. **Artifact Extraction**: Capture UI and documentation as reusable Artifacts.
6. **Token Optimization**: Prune unnecessary context to keep responses fast and focused.

### Operating principles

- **Chain of Thought is Key**: Encourage Claude to think step-by-step to avoid logic errors.
- **Artifact-First for UI**: Use Artifacts to isolate UI experiments from the main codebase.
- **Context is Currency**: Only provide the context that is strictly necessary for the current task.
- **Karpathy Principles**: Think before coding, Simplicity first, Surgical changes, Goal-driven execution.

## Quick example

**Strategy:** Use "Chain of Thought" to debug a race condition.

"Think step-by-step: Analyze the event loop, identify where the concurrent state mutation occurs, and propose a fix using a mutex or state locking."

## Checklist before calling the skill done

- [ ] **Think Before Coding**: Context strategy and "Chain of Thought" approach defined.
- [ ] **Simplicity First**: Achieved the goal with the most token-efficient prompt.
- [ ] **Surgical Changes**: Only updated the files that truly needed modification.
- [ ] **Goal-Driven Execution**: Verification plan includes specific tests for AI-generated code.
- [ ] Project Instructions configured correctly in `CLAUDE.md`.
- [ ] Context window usage optimized (no redundant file uploads).
- [ ] Artifacts used for all UI and visual demonstrations.
