## Overview (80/20)

<!-- The vital 20%: what this is, its shape, how to run, where to start. ~5 bullets. -->

- _(purpose)_
- _(architecture in one line)_
- _(how to run / primary workflow)_
- _(biggest constraint or risk)_
- _(where to start reading)_

## Documentation coverage matrix

<!-- Real status per document. A non-trivial repo that is all "complete" on the
first pass is a red flag — be honest with partial/gap. -->
