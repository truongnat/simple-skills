# Authentication & Authorization Implementation Patterns

## Boundary

**`sk-auth-implementation-patterns`** owns **framework-agnostic authentication and authorization implementation patterns, credential/session safety, and policy enforcement**. It does not own **auth architecture selection as the sole concern, vendor-console administration, or deep penetration testing**; route those concerns to the appropriate specialist skill.


Build secure, scalable authentication and authorization systems using industry-standard patterns and modern best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

- Implementing user authentication systems
- Securing REST or GraphQL APIs
- Adding OAuth2/social login
- Implementing role-based access control (RBAC)
- Designing session management
- Migrating authentication systems
- Debugging auth issues
- Implementing SSO or multi-tenancy

## Core Concepts

### 1. Authentication vs Authorization

**Authentication (AuthN)**: Who are you?

- Verifying identity (username/password, OAuth, biometrics)
- Issuing credentials (sessions, tokens)
- Managing login/logout

**Authorization (AuthZ)**: What can you do?

- Permission checking
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Resource ownership validation
- Policy enforcement

### 2. Authentication Strategies

**Session-Based:**

- Server stores session state
- Session ID in cookie
- Traditional, simple, stateful

**Token-Based (JWT):**

- Stateless, self-contained
- Scales horizontally
- Can store claims

**OAuth2/OpenID Connect:**

- Delegate authentication
- Social login (Google, GitHub)
- Enterprise SSO

## Detailed patterns and worked examples

Detailed pattern documentation lives in `references/details.md`. Read that file when the navigation tier above is insufficient.

## Best Practices

1. **Never Store Plain Passwords**: Always hash with bcrypt/argon2
2. **Use HTTPS**: Encrypt data in transit
3. **Short-Lived Access Tokens**: 15-30 minutes max
4. **Secure Cookies**: httpOnly, secure, sameSite flags
5. **Validate All Input**: Email format, password strength
6. **Rate Limit Auth Endpoints**: Prevent brute force attacks
7. **Implement CSRF Protection**: For session-based auth
8. **Rotate Secrets Regularly**: JWT secrets, session secrets
9. **Log Security Events**: Login attempts, failed auth
10. **Use MFA When Possible**: Extra security layer

## Common Pitfalls

- **Weak Passwords**: Enforce strong password policies
- **JWT in localStorage**: Vulnerable to XSS, use httpOnly cookies
- **No Token Expiration**: Tokens should expire
- **Client-Side Auth Checks Only**: Always validate server-side
- **Insecure Password Reset**: Use secure tokens with expiration
- **No Rate Limiting**: Vulnerable to brute force
- **Trusting Client Data**: Always validate on server

## Output

Produce a reusable auth implementation patterns artifact with the selected approach, relevant files or evidence, verification results, limitations or risks, and next steps.

## When not to use

- When the request is outside `sk-auth-implementation-patterns`'s boundary or another specialist is the primary owner.
- When the user needs an attestation, exploit authorization, or production claim that requires separate human approval or evidence.

## Required inputs

- actors, client types, trust boundaries, credential model, framework, and assurance requirements.

## Cross-skill handoffs

- sk-auth-pro for architecture; sk-api-security-pro and sk-security-pro for abuse controls; stack skills for framework wiring; sk-testing-pro for auth regression.
