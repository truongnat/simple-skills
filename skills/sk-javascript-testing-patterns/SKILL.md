# JavaScript Testing Patterns

## Use this skill when

Use this skill for the scenarios listed in the description. Keep the first pass focused on the smallest reproducible example and the requested scope.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the current project conventions and existing tests or diagnostics.
2. Reproduce the behavior or define the expected behavior with a minimal example.
3. Choose the narrowest useful technique and record the evidence.
4. Implement or recommend the smallest change that addresses the verified cause.
5. Run the relevant checks and report failures, residual risk, and next action.

## Output

Produce a test strategy, representative tests, verification output, and any coverage or fixture gaps.

## Detailed reference

Read `references/javascript-testing-patterns-reference.md` for Jest/Vitest/Testing Library setup and detailed pattern examples.
Do not load the reference wholesale when the compact workflow is sufficient.

## Boundary

**`sk-javascript-testing-patterns`** owns JavaScript/TypeScript test design patterns: deterministic fixtures, user-observable assertions, integration boundaries, async/timer handling, mock isolation, and test maintainability.

It does **not** own Expo product behavior, native platform rendering, server-state policy, or final release verification. Route Expo data behavior to `sk-expo-data-fetching`, native UI behavior to `sk-expo-native-ui`, and final claim evaluation to `sk-verify-pro`.

## Required inputs

- language/framework version, target behavior, existing code/context, constraints, and verification target.
- State assumptions explicitly when context, ownership, or evidence is incomplete.

## Cross-skill handoffs

- sk-testing-pro for test strategy; sk-systematic-debugging-pro for diagnosis; sk-clean-code or architecture skills for cross-cutting design; neighboring stack skill for integration.

For a release or handoff, package each result with `Claim`, `Criteria`, `Evidence`, `Coverage map`, `Limitations`, `Decision`, and `Next owner`; `sk-verify-pro` owns the final status semantics.
## Worked scenarios and evidence

Read [`references/worked-scenarios-and-evidence.md`](./references/worked-scenarios-and-evidence.md) for one positive and one negative/edge fixture with expected output-level evidence and canonical handoff.
